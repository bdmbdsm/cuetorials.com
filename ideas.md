### thoughts

(context: cue/flow and importing tasks)

note to dev, think about leaving incomplete and ignoring
tool imports / usage in regular CUE? (so can at least
be referenced in regular cue, able to unify with the schema,
but only evaluate when in scripting mode.

This should enable reusable imports more easily
and keep the tool evaluation from needing to leave
the current module.
