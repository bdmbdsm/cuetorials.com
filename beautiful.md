# CUE is a Beautiful Language

???
I'm probably CUE's biggest fan.
Once it clicked for me,
I saw a deep beauty in the
design, implementation, and possibilities.
Let me elaborate...
???

- intro / what is CUE trying to be
  - teaser of the beauties?
  - background
  - philosophically ("wrap code in data, not data in code")
  - how I came to find CUE
- generally an impressive and ambitious project

- proper language for config & data
  - logical, say what not how
  - not turing complete, oddball, so draws appreciation
  - orderless, parts unified together
  - templates and pattern matching
  - comments, loops, other features
  - packages, modules, imports
  - push vs pull

- mathematical properties
  - algebra / group
  - the lattice
- the evaluator
- as a tool (the way go is a language in the service of software engineering)

- potential for CUE is awe inspiring
  - anywhere config (especially yaml) is used
  - anywhere there is data or a schema
  - anywhere there is transformation, ETL, dags
  - microservices and aligning apis & versions
- projects
  - CUE will eat DevOps, check out dagger.io
  - ... Thema
  - building Hofstadter on it
    - brief gen, dm, flow & touch of story

- there's a lot of competitors out there, CUE will win
  (has the experience to inform, comes from an impressive pedigree)
- how to get started with CUE

- can apply a schema to data, and also calculate new fields, add cross field checks
