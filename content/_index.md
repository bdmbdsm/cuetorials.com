### About this tutorial

Welcome to __Cuetorials__ where you can
_learn you some CUE for great good!_
We hope this site will help you get started with Cuelang (CUE)
and become an invaluable resource as you
continue to learn and grow your CUE usage.
Cuetorials was created to deepen our own understanding
and to share the learnings with everyone else.

Much credit must be given to Marcel van Lohuizen, the creator of Cue.
Marcel helped create the major configuration systems at Google.
He said they always chose the object-oriented approach
while the logical, non-programming CUE approach
is the correct choice for these systems.
His unique experiences give him the perspective
to create an effective and efficient language for
configuration, data, schemas, transformations, and much more.
